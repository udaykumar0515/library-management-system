# 📚 Library Management System (MySQL + Python)

This is a simple **Library Management System** built using **Python** and **MySQL**, with the help of the `Faker` library to auto-generate mock data for students and books.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generate fake **student** and **book** records easily.
- Assign books to students with random issuance.
- Fully integrated with MySQL for data persistence.
- Organized structure with support for `.env`-based credential protection.
- Clean and simple interface for demonstrating library data.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install mysql-connector-python faker python-dotenv
````

## 🧱 Database Setup

Before running the project, you **must create a MySQL database** named `librarydb`. Use the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE librarydb;
```

Next, create the necessary tables:

```sql
USE librarydb;

CREATE TABLE Students (
    Card_ID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Course VARCHAR(100),
    Year INT
);

CREATE TABLE Library (
    BK_ID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    BK_NAME VARCHAR(100),
    AUTHOR_NAME VARCHAR(100),
    GENRE VARCHAR(100),
    BK_STATUS VARCHAR(20),
    CARD_ID VARCHAR(10)
);
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Instead of hardcoding credentials, store them in a `.env` file at the root of your project.

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=librarydb
```

**Never commit this file to GitHub!**

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

* Delete existing records from `Students` and `Library` tables.
* Generate 30 fake students.
* Generate 50 fake books (some marked as "Issued").
* Populate your database.
